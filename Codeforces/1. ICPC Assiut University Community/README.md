# ICPC Assiut University Community Problems

This directory contains my solutions to the problem sheets provided by the ICPC Assiut University Community. These sheets are a collection of problems designed to prepare for competitive programming contests.

## Sheets Overview

Each sheet focuses on a specific topic or set of topics within competitive programming, ranging from basic data types to more complex data structures and algorithms.

### Available Sheets

- [x] [Sheet #1 (Data type - Conditions)](./Sheet%20%231%20(Data%20type%20-%20Conditions)/) - Focuses on fundamental data types and conditional statements.
- [x] [Contest #1 (Data type - Conditions)](./Contest%20%231/) - Focuses on fundamental data types and conditional statements.
- [x] [Sheet #2 (Loops)](./Sheet%20%232%20(Loops)/) - Concentrates on mastering different types of loops and their applications in programming.
- [x] [Contest #2 (Loops)](./Contest%20%232/) - Concentrates on mastering different types of loops and their applications in programming.
- [ ] [Sheet #3 (Arrays)](./Sheet%20%233%20(Arrays)/) *(In Progress)* - Concentrates on mastering the use of arrays for storing and manipulating collections of data.

## Using These Solutions

To run the solutions, follow the setup instructions in the main [README.md](/README.md) of the repository which discusses how to use tools like `dotnet-exec` for C# files.

## Contributing

While this is primarily a personal project for educational purposes, I am open to suggestions and discussions. If you find any issues or have alternative solutions, feel free to open an issue in the main repository.
