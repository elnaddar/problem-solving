# Sheet #3: Arrays

This sheet focuses on arrays, a fundamental data structure in programming. It includes a variety of problems designed to help you master the use of arrays for storing and manipulating collections of data. By working through these exercises, you'll learn how to efficiently handle operations such as accessing elements, iterating through arrays, and performing common tasks like searching and sorting. These skills are essential for managing and processing data in many programming scenarios.
