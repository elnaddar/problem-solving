# Sheet #2: Loops

This sheet is dedicated to mastering the concepts and application of loops in programming. It aims to strengthen your ability to automate repetitive tasks and implement iterative solutions effectively through various types of loops such as for-loops, while-loops, and nested loops. The exercises will help you understand loop control structures, including breaking out of loops and skipping iterations, to efficiently manage complex looping scenarios and solve problems that require repetitive actions.
