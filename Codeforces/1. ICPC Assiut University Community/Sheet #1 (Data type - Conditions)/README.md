# Sheet #1: Data Types and Conditions

This sheet focuses on enhancing understanding and skills related to basic programming data types and conditional logic in programming. The problems are designed to build a solid foundation in using data types effectively and applying condition statements to solve various challenges.

## Problems and Solutions
