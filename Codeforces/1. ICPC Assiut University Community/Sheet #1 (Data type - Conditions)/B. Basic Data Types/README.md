# B. Basic Data Types

| Data Type in C++ | Size in Memory (C++) | Data Type in C# | Size in Memory (C#) |
|------------------|----------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| int              | 32 bits              | int             | 32 bits             |
| long long        | 64 bits              | long            | 64 bits             |
| char             | 8 bits               | char            | 16 bits             |
| float            | 32 bits              | float           | 32 bits             |
| double           | 64 bits              | double          | 64 bits             |

### Notes:
1. **C++ 'int' and C# 'int'** both typically represent a 32-bit integer, though this can depend on the system architecture.
2. **C++ 'long long'** is mapped to C# 'long', both representing a 64-bit integer.
3. **C++ `char`** is typically 8 bits and used for characters and symbols. **C# `char`** is slightly different as it uses Unicode characters, hence it is 16 bits.
4. **C++ 'float' and 'double'** are directly analogous to C# 'float' and 'double', respectively, used for floating-point numbers of specified precision.
