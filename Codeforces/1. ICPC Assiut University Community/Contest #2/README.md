# Contest #2: Loops

This sheet is dedicated to mastering the concepts and application of loops in programming. It aims to strengthen your ability to automate repetitive tasks and implement iterative solutions effectively through various types of loops such as for-loops, while-loops, and nested loops. The exercises will help you understand loop control structures, including breaking out of loops and skipping iterations, to efficiently manage complex looping scenarios and solve problems that require repetitive actions.

## Problems and Solutions

Here is a list of problems from this sheet along with links to their solutions and a brief description of each:

- **Problem 1: [A. Timon and Pumbaa](./A.%20Timon%20and%20Pumbaa/)** - This problem deals with understanding taking user input and giving a specific output based on specific condition.
    - [C++ Solution](./A.%20Timon%20and%20Pumbaa/main.cpp).
    - [C# Solution](./A.%20Timon%20and%20Pumbaa/main.cs).
    - [Dart Solution](./A.%20Timon%20and%20Pumbaa/main.dart).

## Solution Approach

Each solution file includes:
- A link to the problem (if publicly available).
- My initial thoughts and approach to solving the problem.
- The complete, commented code for the solution.

## Using These Solutions
