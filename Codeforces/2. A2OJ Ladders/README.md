# A2OJ Ladders Overview

This collection is part of the A2OJ Ladders, which are specially designed problem sets aimed at preparing participants for competitive programming contests. Each ladder is targeted at users with specific Codeforces ratings, ranging from beginners to advanced competitors.

## Ladders Description

Each ladder contains problems that match a specific range of Codeforces ratings, ensuring that the difficulty level is appropriate for the users' skills and experience. The problems in these ladders cover a variety of topics, from basic programming tasks to more complex algorithms and data structures, providing a comprehensive training ground for enhancing competitive programming abilities. This structured approach helps in gradually increasing the complexity and variety of problems, allowing users to continuously challenge themselves and improve their coding proficiency.

### Available Ladders

- [x] [Sheet #1 (Data type - Conditions)](./Sheet%20%231%20(Data%20type%20-%20Conditions)/) - Focuses on fundamental data types and conditional statements. -->

## Using These Solutions

To run the solutions, follow the setup instructions in the main [README.md](/README.md) of the repository which discusses how to use tools like `dotnet-exec` for C# files.

## Contributing

While this is primarily a personal project for educational purposes, I am open to suggestions and discussions. If you find any issues or have alternative solutions, feel free to open an issue in the main repository.
