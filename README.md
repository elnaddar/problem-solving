# Problem Solving Repository

Welcome to my Problem Solving Repository where I share my solutions to various coding challenges from platforms like Codeforces and LeetCode. This repository is designed to track my progress and help others who are looking for references or insights into the problem-solving process.

## Repository Structure

- `Codeforces/`: This directory contains solutions to problems I've tackled on Codeforces. Each file is named after the problem ID and contest number, e.g., `CF123A.cs`.
- `LeetCode/`: This directory includes my solutions to LeetCode problems. Files are named according to the problem ID or title, e.g., `0001_Two_Sum.cs`.

## Problems and Solutions

Each problem solution file includes:
- The problem link at the top as a comment.
- A brief description or my thoughts about the problem and the solution approach.
- The complete code for the solution.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse the repository to find solutions to specific problems or explore different solution strategies. If you're working on similar problems and have questions or alternative solutions, you can open an issue to discuss it further.

### Running C# Solutions
For executing individual C# files, I use the [dotnet-exec tool](https://github.com/WeihanLi/dotnet-exec). This tool allows for the direct execution of C# scripts, making it simpler to test and run snippets of code quickly. To run a C# solution file using this tool, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed.
2. Install `dotnet-exec` by running the following command:
    ```powershell
    dotnet tool install -g dotnet-exec
    ```
3. Navigate to the directory containing the C# file you wish to run.
4. Execute the file using:

This setup is particularly useful for quickly testing and iterating on solutions.

## Contributing

Since this is a personal repository mainly for educational and tracking purposes, I am currently not accepting contributions. However, suggestions and discussions are welcome!
