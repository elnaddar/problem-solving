# Problem Solving Repository

Welcome to my Problem Solving Repository where I share my solutions to various coding challenges from platforms like Codeforces and LeetCode. This repository is designed to track my progress and help others who are looking for references or insights into the problem-solving process.

## Repository Structure

- `Codeforces/`: This directory contains solutions to problems I've tackled on Codeforces. Each file is named after the problem ID and contest number, e.g., `CF123A.cs`.
- `LeetCode/`: This directory includes my solutions to LeetCode problems. Files are named according to the problem ID or title, e.g., `0001_Two_Sum.cs`.

## Problems and Solutions

Each problem solution file includes:
- The problem link at the top as a comment.
- A brief description or my thoughts about the problem and the solution approach.
- The complete code for the solution.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse the repository to find solutions to specific problems or explore different solution strategies. If you're working on similar problems and have questions or alternative solutions, you can open an issue to discuss it further.

## Contributing

Since this is a personal repository mainly for educational and tracking purposes, I am currently not accepting contributions. However, suggestions and discussions are welcome!


## Acknowledgements

Thanks to Codeforces and LeetCode for providing a platform full of rich problems that help in honing programming and analytical skills.
